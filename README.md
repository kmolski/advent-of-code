# [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020) solutions

My Advent of Code 2020 solutions in Java 11, with automated testing & building included.

Each top-level folder contains:
- the solution for the given day
- a Makefile for building and testing the solution against the expected output
- a README with information about the environment and used resources.
