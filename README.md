# [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020) solutions

My Advent of Code 2020 solutions in Java 11, with automated testing & building included.
Each top-level folder contains a solution for the given day, a Makefile that can be used to build and test the solution
against the expected output, and a README that contains some information about the environment and used resources.
